# GoUrlEncode

This repository contains a simple URL encoder application implemented in Go. The application takes in a string as input and returns its URL-encoded equivalent.

## Building the application

To build the application, you will need to have Go installed on your system. Once you have Go set up, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.
3. Run the following command:
```
go build -o goencode.go
```

This will create an executable binary named `goencode` in the current directory.

## Running the application

To run the application, simply run the following command in the terminal:

```
./goencode -s "A sample text with anything @#$%&"
```
